Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Samadhan Tikone, and I recently received an email from your company regarding a scheduled interview today at 5:30 PM on Skype with the Skype ID: live:.cid.c06b522e44bc881e.

At the appointed time, I made several requests to connect via the given Skype ID, but unfortunately, I did not receive any response. I understand that there may have been some office work or technical issues that prevented the connection.

I am very interested in the opportunity to interview with your company and would like to inquire if it would be possible to reschedule the interview for tomorrow or at a time that is convenient for you.

Please let me know your availability, and I will do my best to accommodate it.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Best regards,
SAMADHAN TIKONE
